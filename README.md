 ## :book: Description 
 this is my road to studing design Pattersn spired by [Design Patterns for Humans](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/design-patterns-for-humans)
 each branch is a implmentation in typescript of a especific design patern

 ## :link: Types of Design Patterns
 * [Creational](#building_construction-Creational)
 * [Structural](#classical_building-Structural)

 his focues is how to intatiate an object or group of relates objects.

 ## :factory: Abstract Factory
 this pattern is responsable for create certan type of objects lets imgagin one veichle factory, this factory have two another factorys one create sportive vehicles another popular vehicles. 
<img src= "./assets/create/AbstractFactory.png">
 * [code](https://github.com/nicolaskruger/designPatterns/tree/abstractFactory)
## 	:bricks: Factory Method
 Factory Method switch operations depends on your concrete object, lets imagin two cereal brand sucrilhos end nescal, bouth have the same method cereal that gives the cereal, but each one gives a specrifica ceral, for that we create one abstracte class CeralBox that give the cereal with a function giveCereal, and this class have one abstract mathod that create the sereal. That abstract method need to be inplmentede for a concrete class.
 
 <img src= "./assets/create/FactoryMethod.png">
 
 * [code](https://github.com/nicolaskruger/designPatterns/tree/FactoryMethod)
  
## :houses: Builder
Builder is a design patern that allow you to buil complex objects step by step.

 <img src= "./assets/create/Builder.png">
 
 * [code](https://github.com/nicolaskruger/designPatterns/tree/builder)
 
 ## :robot: Prototype
 This pattern allow you to copy existing objects without make your code being dependent of yous classes.
 
 <img src= "./assets/create/Clone.png">
 
* [code](https://github.com/nicolaskruger/designPatterns/tree/Prototype)

## :one: Singleton

This pattern ensure that one class have only one instance.

 <img src= "./assets/create/Singleton.png">
 
 * [code](https://github.com/nicolaskruger/designPatterns/tree/Singleton)
 ## :electric_plug:	Adapter

 Allow objects with incompatible interfaces co-work toogeter.
 
 <img src= "./assets/structural/Adapter.png">
 
  * [code](https://github.com/nicolaskruger/designPatterns/tree/Adapter)
  
  ## :bridge_at_night: Bridge
  
  That patter allow you to split one big class or one arrange of classes in two diferents hierarchy.
  
  
 <img src= "./assets/structural/Bridge.png">
 
  * [code](https://github.com/nicolaskruger/designPatterns/tree/Bridge)
  
  ## :deciduous_tree: Composite
  
  This pattern allow you so store your's objects in tree extructure
  
   <img src= "./assets/structural/Composite.png">
   
   * [code](https://github.com/nicolaskruger/designPatterns/tree/Composite)

## :dolls: Decorator

This is a pattern that allow you add new behavior to objects when this are inside other object.

   <img src= "./assets/structural/Decorator.png">
   
   * [code](https://github.com/nicolaskruger/designPatterns/tree/Decorator)
   
 ## :classical_building: Facede
 
 Pattern that gives simplificate interface to complex system
 
  <img src= "./assets/structural/Facede.png">
 
 * [code](https://github.com/nicolaskruger/designPatterns/tree/Facede)
 
 ## :balance_scale: Flyweight
 
 This pattern allow you to put more objects on less RAM space. By sharyng the comun state of multiples objects.
 
  <img src= "./assets/structural/Flyweight.png">
 
 * [code](https://github.com/nicolaskruger/designPatterns/tree/Flyweight)
  
  ## :package: Proxy
 
 This pattern allow you to do things before and/or after one request
 
  <img src= "./assets/structural/Proxy.png">
 
 * [code](https://github.com/nicolaskruger/designPatterns/tree/Proxy)
 
 ## :link: Chain of Responsibility
 
 This pattern allow a lot of objects to deal one request without couple the sender class to concrete destiny class. The chain could be composed dinamicaly in execution time.
 
  <img src= "./assets/behavioral/Chain.png">
 
 * [code](https://github.com/nicolaskruger/designPatterns/tree/Chain)
 
 
  ## :joystick: Command
 
 This pattern is used to uncouple GUI end the logic of the system
 
  <img src= "./assets/behavioral/Command.png">
 
 * [code](https://github.com/nicolaskruger/designPatterns/tree/Command)
 
## :walking_woman: Iterator
 
 Allow you to go through elemets of one colection without show his representation
 
   <img src= "./assets/behavioral/Iterator.png">
 
 * [code](https://github.com/nicolaskruger/designPatterns/tree/Iterator)
 
 ## :vertical_traffic_light: Mediator
 
 This pattern allow you to reduce dependences between objects.
 
  <img src= "./assets/behavioral/Mediator.png">
 
 * [code](https://github.com/nicolaskruger/designPatterns/tree/Mediator)
 
 ## :camera: Memento
 
 This pattern allow you to store a stete of object.
 
  <img src= "./assets/behavioral/Memento.png">
 
 * [code](https://github.com/nicolaskruger/designPatterns/tree/Memento)
 
 ## :telescope: Observer
 
 This patter notify a list of objects about one event.
 
 <img src= "./assets/behavioral/Observer.png">
 
 * [code](https://github.com/nicolaskruger/designPatterns/tree/Observer)

 ## :traffic_light:	State

  This pattern change the behavior when change state

  <img src= "./assets/behavioral/State.png">
 
 * [code](https://github.com/nicolaskruger/designPatterns/tree/State)

 ## :golfing: Strategy

  this pattern allow you to define one family of algorithm, put this classes sepatreted, and make this objects work together

  <img src= "./assets/behavioral/Strategy.png">
 
 * [code](https://github.com/nicolaskruger/designPatterns/tree/Strategy)

## :bookmark_tabs: Template Method

  This pattern define a template algorithm on superclass, and let the subclass to subscribe the steps.

<img src= "./assets/behavioral/Template.png">
 
 * [code](https://github.com/nicolaskruger/designPatterns/tree/Template)

 ## :space_invader: Visitor

 This pattern allow you to splite algorithms and objects

 <img src= "./assets/behavioral/Visitor.png">
 
 * [code](https://github.com/nicolaskruger/designPatterns/tree/Visitor)
